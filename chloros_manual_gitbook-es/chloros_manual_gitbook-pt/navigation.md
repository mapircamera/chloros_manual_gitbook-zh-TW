From the main menu you can start a new project, open an existing project or open the project folder.

### <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Play/Start Button

When enabled, the start processing button starts the image processing pipeline.

### <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Progress Bar <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" data-size="line">

In the free Chloros mode, which processes all files sequentially, the progress bar will show 2 stages: Target Detect and Processing.

In the paid Chloros+ licensed mode, which process all files simultaneously, the progress bar shows 4 stages: Detecting, Analyzing, Calibrating, Exporting. If you hover your mouse cursor over the Chloros+ progress bar it will drop down the extended 4 progress bar panel so you can follow along. Clicking the top progress bar will freeze the dropdown panel, clicking again unfreezes it.
