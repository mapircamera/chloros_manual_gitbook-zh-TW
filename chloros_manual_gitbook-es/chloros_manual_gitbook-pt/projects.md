Select "Open Project" to see a list of existing projects in the Project Folder. If no projects exist the secondary side menu will not open. You can see some GUI created projects (t1, t2, t3) listed in the above photo. The DATE\_TIME projects were created by the CLI using the default project naming scheme. Clicking any project name will open it.

Clicking the "Open Project Folder" button opens your computer's file explorer at the project path. You can adjust the project path in the [Project Settings](project-settings/page-2.md).
